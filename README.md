# rack-lineprof

Rack middleware for [rblineprof](https://github.com/tmm1/rblineprof).
Makes line-by-line source code profiling easy.

## Example

Add to Gemfile:
```rb
gem 'rblineprof', github: 'tmm1/rblineprof' # required until v0.3.1 is pushed
gem 'rack-lineprof'
```

Add middleware to any Rack app (e.g. config/routes.rb):
```rb
config.middleware.use Rack::Lineprof
```

Use query parameter to profile a request:
```sh
curl 'http://localhost:3000/slow-page?lineprof=app/models'
```
